## ROI Calculation Framework

### Step 1: Identify Baseline Metrics

**Data to Collect**:
- Current time spent on task (hours)
- Frequency of task (per day/week/month)
- Number of people performing task
- Average hourly cost (salary + overhead)
- Current error rate
- Rework time due to errors

### Step 2: Estimate Automation Impact

**Key Assumptions**:
- Expected time reduction % (based on use case)
- Number of tasks to be automated
- Adoption rate (gradual rollout)
- Quality improvement %

### Step 3: Calculate Financial Impact

**Formula**:
```
Annual Time Saved = (
    (Current Time per Task - Automated Time per Task)
    × Tasks per Year
    × Number of Users
    × Adoption Rate
)

Annual Labor Cost Savings = Annual Time Saved × Blended Hourly Rate

Error Reduction Value = (
    Current Error Rate - New Error Rate
) × Rework Cost per Error × Volume

Total Annual Value = Labor Savings + Error Reduction + Revenue Enablement
```

### Step 4: Calculate Implementation Costs

**Cost Components**:
- Claude subscription/API costs
- Implementation labor (internal + consulting)
- Training and change management
- Infrastructure (servers, storage, etc.)
- Ongoing maintenance and support

**Formula**:
```
Total Implementation Cost =
    Subscription Fees
    + Development Costs
    + Training Costs
    + Infrastructure Costs
    + Integration Costs
    + Contingency (10-20%)
```

### Step 5: Calculate ROI Metrics

**Key Metrics**:
```
ROI % = ((Total Annual Value - Implementation Cost) / Implementation Cost) × 100

Payback Period = Implementation Cost / Monthly Value (in months)

NPV (3 years) = Σ(Annual Value / (1 + Discount Rate)^year) - Implementation Cost
```

## Sample ROI Calculator

### Scenario: Document Generation Automation

**Inputs**:
- Task: Generate quarterly compliance reports
- Current time: 12 hours per report
- Frequency: 4 reports per quarter
- Analysts: 15
- Hourly cost: $85
- Expected automation: 80% (12 hrs → 2.4 hrs)

**Calculations**:
```
Annual tasks: 4 quarters × 15 analysts = 60 reports
Time saved per report: 12 - 2.4 = 9.6 hours
Annual time saved: 9.6 × 60 = 576 hours
Annual cost savings: 576 × $85 = $48,960

Implementation costs:
- Claude Enterprise (20 users): $14,400
- Development (2 weeks): $15,000
- Training: $3,000
- Total: $32,400

Year 1 ROI: ($48,960 - $32,400) / $32,400 = 51%
Payback period: 8 months

Year 2 ROI (only subscription cost): ($48,960 - $14,400) / $14,400 = 240%
```

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Common Risks

**Implementation Risks**:
- **Underestimated complexity**: Add 20% contingency
- **Low adoption**: Invest in change management
- **Integration challenges**: Allocate sufficient development time
- **Skill quality issues**: Thorough testing and parallel running

**Operational Risks**:

- **Data privacy**: Comprehensive security review
- **Vendor dependency**: Contractual protections

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Pilot First**: Test with small group before full rollout
2. **Parallel Processing**: Run manual and automated in parallel initially
3. **Incremental Rollout**: Gradual expansion reduces risk
4. **Clear Governance**: Approval processes and guidelines
5. **Vendor Relationship**: Regular check-ins, escalation paths
